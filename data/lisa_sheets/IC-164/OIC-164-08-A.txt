'''Epidemiology/physiopathology/natural evolution''''

- Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause (discussed here), but IM can also be associated with CMV, HIV or toxoplasmosis (see monucleosis syndrome).

- EBV belongs to the ''Herpesviridae'' family, subfamily ''gamma-herpesvirinae'', genus ''lymphocryptovirus''.

''-'' human-to-human transmission via the respiratory route (saliva)

- The preferred age for primary infection is adolescence, but it can occur in younger children (acute or prolonged fever ([[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044]], [[Prolonged fever]]) or in adults.

- 80-90% of adults immunised (in France and wealthy countries)

- possibility of asymptomatic reactivation in immunocompetent patients, symptomatic reactivation in immunocompromised patients (transplants)

Clinical features

'''-'''' incubation 4 to 6 weeks

- prolonged contagiousness after infection (salivary excretion)

'''- The typical clinical picture''' associates a fever of variable intensity, which may be prolonged, significant asthenia, pseudomembranous angina ([[Angina in adults and children and rhinopharyngitis in children]], [Odynophagia/dysphagia SD-052]]), cervical ''polyadenopathy'' ([[Superficial adenopathy of adults and children]], [[Single or multiple adenopathy SD-016]]) but other territories may be affected, often with ''splenomegaly''.

The rash is inconstant, maculopapular and favoured by ampicillin use. Facial oedema may be present

Other signs and symptoms may be associated, such as hepatomegaly and hepatalgia, and more rarely jaundice.

EBV infection can also present as a prolonged fever, particularly in young children.

Symptoms vary in duration, and adolescents may experience marked asthenia.


'''Biologically'''

'''Mononucleosis syndrome [[Leukocyte abnormality SD-216|(Leukocyte abnormality SD-216]]''', sometimes thrombocytopenia

Hepatic cytolysis [[Hep|frequent]]

Diagnosis is based on "serology" and the presence of anti-VCA IgM without anti-EBNA IgG.


'''Complications/seriousness'''

-Obstructive ENT: linked to tonsillar and adenoid hypertrophy, and rare but possible superinfection: sinuses, middle ear, cavum,

-Rarer complications: cardiac (myocarditis and pericarditis), haematological (haemolytic anaemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia), neurological (lymphocytic meningitis, meningoencephalitis),

-In immunocompromised patients: lymphoproliferative syndrome

- In predisposed individuals (Purtilo syndrome): monocytomacrophagic activation syndrome

- EBV is also a risk factor for Burkitt's lymphoma


'''Differential diagnoses'''

- Other infections

- Bacterial: Scarlet fever (erythematopulmonary angina), exceptional diphtheria (extensive pseudomembranous angina)

           - Viral: CMV (no angina), primary HIV infection (caution with adolescents),

           - Parasitic: toxoplasmosis (cervical adenopathy, sometimes general signs)

- Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (particularly DRESS)

- Lymphoma (polyadenopathies)

- Kawasaki disease
