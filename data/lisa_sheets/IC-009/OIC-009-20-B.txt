== I- Evolution of the rule of law and the law on the end of life ==
To understand what is at stake and how the end of life is dealt with, we need to know how society's view of the issue has evolved, as reflected in changes in the law.

* The circular of 26 August 1986: the "Laroque" circular, relating to the organisation of care and support for terminally ill patients, defined palliative care for the first time in France, which it called "support care", as "aimed at meeting the specific needs of people who have reached the end of their lives";

* <nowiki>The law of 9 June 1999 aimed at guaranteeing the right of access to palliative care: it opens up the right to palliative care and support to "any sick person whose condition so requires". Article 1 defines palliative care as "active and continuous care provided by an interdisciplinary team in an institution or at home, [which] aims to relieve pain, alleviate physical suffering, safeguard the dignity of the sick person and support those around them".

* The law of 4 March 2002, known as the "Kouchner law", on patients' rights, places the individual at the centre of the decision-making process concerning him or her. The law stipulates that "all persons, together with their healthcare professional and taking into account the information and recommendations provided by the latter, make decisions concerning their health" and specifies that "no medical procedure or treatment may be carried out without the free and informed consent of the person concerned". Doctors are also obliged to inform patients about their state of health, treatments and their possible consequences. This law also introduces the possibility of appointing a "trusted support person", who must be consulted if the patient is unable to express his or her opinion.

* The law of 22 April 2005, known as the "Léonetti law", relating to patients' rights and the end of life, reaffirms the right of every person "to refuse or not to receive treatment" or not to refuse unreasonable obstinacy. It recognises the possibility for doctors, in the name of the same principle, to limit or stop care and/or to apply a treatment that may have the secondary effect of shortening life, if they "establish that they cannot relieve the suffering of a person in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease" (this is known as the double effect), provided that they inform the patient, the trusted support person, the family or, failing that, one of the next of kin. It gives these people the right to request that their treatment be limited or stopped, and obliges doctors to respect their wishes "after informing them of the consequences of their choice". It states that any person of legal age may "draw up advance directives in the event that he or she should one day be unable to express his or her wishes", which "indicate the person's wishes regarding the conditions for limiting or stopping treatment at the end of his or her life". The doctor must take these into account when making any decision "provided that they were drawn up less than three years before the person became unconscious".

* The law of 2 February 2016, known as the "Claeys-Léonetti law", creates new rights for patients and people at the end of life. If the patient is unable to express his or her wishes, the law requires the doctor to "ascertain the patient's expressed wishes" (art. 10), in particular through the use of advance directives and the trusted support person where these exist.	It introduces the right to "deep and continuous sedation" for a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease, when "their vital prognosis is at risk in the short term [and they] are experiencing suffering that is refractory to treatment", or when their decision to stop treatment "involves their vital prognosis in the short term and is likely to result in unbearable suffering". Deep and continuous sedation is the name given to the care process that consists of using medication to relieve pain. It involves a reduction or loss of the patient's consciousness. Under this law, euthanasia and assisted suicide remain prohibited in France.

The law thus makes it possible to respond to two medical situations: limiting care and stopping care. Both are designed to avoid unreasonable obstinacy.

* Limitation means refraining from using means likely to prolong a life that is in serious danger. This means not undertaking certain life-prolonging treatments which are technically possible but which do not aim to improve the patient's condition;
* Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment: this is the suspension of life-sustaining treatment in progress, for example artificial respiration.

In all cases, the issue of information and consent is central. A decision may or may not be taken at the patient's request, and it is essential to know the patient's feelings and last wishes. Two situations must be distinguished and discussed:

* When the patient has made a request or is able to take part in the discussion with the team;
* When the patient has not expressed anything, or can no longer express anything, and the request comes from relatives (questioning the patient's wishes and challenging the concept of autonomy).

When patients are unconscious or have reduced capacity for expression and comprehension, incorporating the patient's opinion and consent into decision-making is highly problematic. There are several possible approaches:

* Advance directives are a way for mentally competent people, who have lost their capacity to express themselves, to establish in advance and in writing how they would like to be treated in the event of hospitalisation. Among other things, they can concern end-of-life decisions, meaning that the person can specify the type of decision they would like to be made. But it is still rare for patients to write one;
* The testimony of relatives or the trusted support person: this testimony is necessary, but it raises questions (which relatives? how reliable? how hierarchical are these relatives?).

In all cases, by law and in accordance with good professional practice, healthcare professionals have a duty to act collegially. The limitation or cessation of treatment cannot be carried out unless a collegial procedure has been followed between professionals and the patient's advance directives have been taken into account (if they exist) or the trusted support person, the family or, failing that, a close relative has been consulted.

Each stage of the reasoned decision to limit or stop treatment must be recorded in the medical record.

== II- Place and role of the trusted support person at the end of life ==
In addition to optimising the patient's right to information, other rights have led to the introduction of new practices to improve the relationship between carers and patients.

The right to appoint a trusted support person was enshrined in the French Public Health Code following the law of 4 March 2002.

For a long time, healthcare teams have been concerned to see how a person close to the patient, as a third party and mediator, can help to build links in the care process and give the patient a voice, particularly when the patient is unable or unwilling to take part in the decision alone. This reflection led to the introduction of the concept of the "trusted support person" in the "health democracy" law of 4 March 2002.

The role of the trusted support person, in its original sense, is to assist the patient in his or her care, to support him or her physically and/or psychologically and to act as a link with the medical teams. In other words, they support the patient's day-to-day care, choices and decisions.

This primary role deserves to be emphasised because, sometimes, the trusted support person is still only perceived as an interlocutor in major crisis situations, such as, for example, stopping or limiting care at the end of life or the question of post-mortem organ removal; situations in which the trusted support person has to testify to the patient's wishes. The role of the trusted support person is to provide support during the course of standard care.

== III- Drawing up end-of-life advance directives ==
The law of 22 April 2005 on patients' rights and the end of life introduced the possibility of refusing care if it appears to be "useless, disproportionate or having no effect other than the artificial maintenance of life". This refusal takes the form of stopping or limiting curative or palliative care, resulting in the patient's death in the more or less short term. This approach, authorised by law, has been described as a "right to die". Law no. 2016-87 of 2 February 2016, known as the "end of life" law, is a development of the 2005 law and strengthens the rights of patients at the end of life, and specifies the important role that advance directives can play.

In an end-of-life situation, in ethical terms, the decisive factor is the patient's degree of autonomy of thought, which is the true criterion for qualifying his or her ability to develop a coherent and considered argument in the face of such a decision.

In practice, there are two possible scenarios:

1) If the patient is aware and capable of taking part in a deliberative process, supported by the acquisition of sufficient knowledge about their illness and how it is progressing (transmitted by the doctor), they will be involved in this decision. The doctor and patient then engage in a complex and intimate exchange in which the patient expresses his inability to fight any further and his wish not to prolong his life. In this way, a dialogue can be established which, over time, can confirm the legitimacy and reality of a request to end life. The doctor can then act on the request, following in-depth discussion and reflection with the patient.

2) For patients who are unable to express their wishes, there is a broad consensus on the importance of seeking their opinion so that it can be included in the decision. This is why the 2005 law states that "when a person, in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease, whatever the cause, is incapable of expressing his or her wishes, the doctor may decide to limit or stop treatment that is useless or incapable of improving the patient's condition, after respecting the collegial procedure and consulting the trusted support person, the family and, where appropriate, the patient's advance directives". To come closer to respecting the patient's wishes, the concept of testifying to what the person would have wished is used here. This testimony may be given in writing by the patient (advance directives), or verbally by those close to the patient, in particular the trusted support person (if the patient has designated one).

The principle of advance directives originated in the United States, also known as living wills, at the end of the 1960s, to enable patients' opinions to be incorporated into the end-of-life decision-making process. In 1990, the Patient Self Determination Act, passed by the US Congress, made it compulsory for patients to be informed of these advance directives on admission to all hospitals. It also obliges professionals to systematically check whether or not their patients have drawn up such documents, and to indicate this in their medical records.  In France, a survey in 2000 revealed that only 6% of patients undergoing life-sustaining treatment (LATA) in intensive care had advance directives or had designated a contact person (equivalent to a trusted support person) authorised to represent them. This is why the 2005 law introduced this system, with the aim of ensuring that professionals offer it to patients, without imposing it, and are obliged to find out whether any directives have been drawn up when they decide to stop or limit treatment.

The changes made to the law in 2016 were necessary to reiterate that refusing any treatment at the end of life is the patient's right and that his or her wishes must be respected. This is why the aim was to strengthen and clarify the role of advance directives. It should be emphasised that, from now on, this law will establish a hierarchy in terms of the ways in which a patient's wishes can be traced: firstly, the advance directives, then failing that, the testimony of the trusted support person, and failing that, any other testimony from the family or close friends.

But questions remain, particularly when patients have not drawn up advance directives, or when these are not adapted to the clinical situation, or when a trusted support person has not been designated, or when relatives disagree. In all these situations, teams must continue to work towards dialogue and ethical discussion in the name of the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence.  



'''What the law on the end of life emphasises:'''

- The idea is for all professionals to be able to discuss this law on the end of life, advance directives and their place in relation to the trusted support person, at the appropriate time, depending on how the illness is progressing, with their patients.

- An obligation on healthcare professionals to use all the means at their disposal to ensure that every person has the right to a dignified end of life accompanied by the best possible alleviation of suffering.

- Recognition of a patient's right to stop or limit treatment as part of the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy.

- An obligation for the doctor to respect the patient's wish to refuse or not to receive treatment, after informing the patient of the consequences of his or her choices and their seriousness.

- A greater role for doctors in informing patients about the possibility of drawing up advance directives and/or appointing a trusted support person.

- The need for collegial decision-making.

- The fact that the advance directives enshrined in the law are now enforceable, meaning that the referring doctors of an unconscious patient must follow the perspectives written in this document if they are appropriate to the medical situation.

- The fact that there is a hierarchy concerning the means of tracing a patient's wishes: first of all the advance directives, then failing that the testimony of the trusted support person, then failing that any other testimony from the family or close friends.
