'''Diagnosis of death prior to removal from a deceased person'''

The definition of death "is only" the result of a social agreement (which varies over time). For a long time, death was recognised through the inanimate or cold corpse. Then came the notion of death due to cardiac arrest and then encephalic death.

In 1959, Mollaret and Goulon defined this new definition of death as encephalic death, but it was not officially recognised until 1968 in the circular legalising the removal of organs from a subject in a state of encephalic death (the so-called Jeanneney circular).

It can therefore be said that today there are two ways of being dead, as stated in "Decree no. 96-1041 of 2 December 1996 on the determination of death prior to the removal of organs, tissues and cells for therapeutic or scientific purposes and amending the Public Health Code".)

# Patient in cardiac arrest (clinical criteria) :
#* Absence of consciousness and spontaneous motor activity with no response to stimulation;
#* Abolition of all brain stem reflexes;
#* Absence of spontaneous ventilation;
#* In this case samples must be taken rapidly.
# Patient in a state of encephalic death:
#* No spontaneous ventilation in hypercapnia test;
#* Two EEGs with no detectable activity 4 hours apart, each recorded for at least 30 minutes and/or cerebral angiography showing the absence of effective circulation;
#* In these cases, sampling may be deferred and the dead body maintained in a circulatory and ventilatory state in order to preserve the quality of the organs. This condition is an important source of organs, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the context of a donation policy.

In this context, it is important to be familiar with the Maastricht classification and the questions it raises:

* people in circulatory arrest, declared dead on admission (Maastricht category I);
* people in circulatory arrest with effective cardiac massage and mechanical ventilation, but without recovery of circulatory activity (Maastricht category II);
* people for whom a decision has been taken to limit or stop treatment because of the prognosis of the pathologies that led to their admission to intensive care (Maastricht category III);
* people who have died of brain death and suffered irreversible circulatory arrest during intensive care (Maastricht category IV).

Encephalic death is little known to the general public; it conveys complex emotional representations for relatives because the body is ventilated and moving. In addition, the general public fears that the body will be removed when there is still a chance of life. So we need to be very clear with family and friends and establish death as a real, irreversible state. We need to listen, explain and support them. There is a strong need for educational clarification on two levels on this subject: firstly, prior to any death, for all citizens and the general public, and secondly, at the time of death, for the next of kin.


'''A special case: organ donation and the medico-legal obstacle'''

* If there is a "medico-legal obstacle" at the time of death... this is not an obstacle or a prohibition on organ removal.
* BUT :
** Agreement of the Public Prosecutor+++ (role of the forensic pathologist+++) / The donation process can sometimes be compatible with the medical-legal process.
** The removal(s) with a view to donation must not involve areas or organs necessary for the expert assessment of the autopsy.
** The question of proof and justice takes precedence over the logic of donation.
