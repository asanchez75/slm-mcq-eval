|Ordre=18}}The Léonetti law of 22 April 2005 on patients' rights and the end of life and the Claeys-Léonetti law of 2 February 2016 aim to improve care for patients at the end of life. The issue here for medicine is not to initiate or prolong active therapies, but to know how to withdraw in order to maintain only so-called palliative care, which can go as far as deep and continuous sedation until death. These laws have thus provided a framework for the possibility (at the request of the patient or next of kin) or even the obligation (for the doctor, and in dialogue with the patient or family) to stop medical treatments that are disproportionate or only contribute to maintaining vital functions, while maintaining care that preserves the patient's dignity.

These laws are part of a profound social and legal movement dating from the 1970s-1980s aimed at promoting patient autonomy and, in particular, giving patients the means to communicate their wishes regarding the end of life. This movement can be explained by advances in medical technology, which now make it possible to prolong life long after patients have lost the ability to express themselves. Artificial respiration, nutrition and circulation can be provided before or during the end of life. Around 70% of the French population die in hospital.

# The right to support at the end of one's life and to refuse unreasonable obstinacy

The Clayes-Léonetti law states that everyone has the right to ''access to palliative care and support at the end of life'': ''Everyone has the right to a dignified end of life accompanied by the best possible relief of suffering. Healthcare professionals will do everything in their power to ensure that this right is respected. "Everyone has the right to receive treatment and care designed to relieve their suffering. In all circumstances, this suffering must be prevented, taken into account, assessed and treated.

The Clayes-Léonetti law reaffirms "the patient's right to refuse or interrupt treatment" or an investigation and prescribes the continuation of his or her follow-up, in particular palliative care. "If, by refusing or interrupting treatment, the patient's life is endangered, he or she must reiterate this decision within a reasonable time. They may call on another member of the medical profession. It imposes an obligation on the doctor to respect the person's wishes, after informing them of the consequences of their choices and their seriousness, to refuse or not to receive treatment.

The 2016 law enshrines '''the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy'''<nowiki>: "When they appear unnecessary, disproportionate or when they have no effect other than the sole artificial maintenance of life, [treatment] may be suspended or not be undertaken, in accordance with the patient's wishes and, if the patient is unable to express his or her wishes, at the end of a collegiate procedure defined by regulation."</nowiki>

The law thus makes it possible to respond to two medical situations: ''limiting care'' and ''stopping care''. Both are designed to avoid unreasonable obstinacy. In the case of limitation, the aim is to refrain from implementing measures likely to prolong a life that is in serious danger. It means not undertaking certain prolongation treatments that are technically possible, but without the aim of improving the patient's condition. Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment involves the suspension of vital treatment in progress, such as artificial respiration.

The 2016 law confirmed that artificial nutrition and hydration should be considered as "treatments" like any others, and may be suspended provided that the patient has, either directly or indirectly (via advance directives, for example), expressed his or her wish not to continue them. If this is the case, patients should be reassured that they will be comfortable and will not feel thirsty (thanks to the vigilance of the care teams, who will offer regular mouth care) or hungry.

For people who are not capable of expressing themselves, no decision to limit treatment may be taken by the doctor without first convening a collegial procedure, the aim of which will be to ascertain the patient's wishes as they may have expressed them previously. This procedure requires a meeting to be held within the healthcare department with all the healthcare professionals familiar with the situation. A second medical opinion must also be given during this collegial procedure. Next, the doctor in charge of the patient must consult the patient's advance directives, or, failing that, the trusted support person and, failing that, the family or close friends. Finally, it is the doctor in charge of the patient who will decide whether or not to stop treatment, having been informed of the patient's wishes.

# The right to deep and continuous sedation

The Clayes-Léonetti law affirms the right to benefit from ''deep and continuous sedation until death when the vital prognosis is engaged in the short term'': ''At the patient's request to avoid all suffering and not to undergo unreasonable obstinacy, deep and continuous sedation causing an alteration of consciousness maintained until death, associated with analgesia and the cessation of all life-sustaining treatments'' is possible in cases that the legislator specifies: "1° When a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease whose vital prognosis is at risk in the short term is suffering in a way that is refractory to treatment; 2° When the decision of a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease to stop treatment is at risk in the short term and is likely to cause unbearable suffering. When the patient is unable to express his or her wishes and, as part of the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy referred to in Article L. 1110-5-1, in the event that the doctor stops life-sustaining treatment, the doctor shall apply deep and continuous sedation causing altered consciousness that is maintained until death, combined with analgesia".

A refractory symptom is defined as one which is unbearably perceptible and which cannot be relieved despite obstinate efforts to find a suitable therapeutic protocol without compromising the patient's consciousness.

Deep and continuous sedation is based on the "double effect argument": "The physician implements all analgesic and sedative treatments to respond to the refractory suffering of the patient in an advanced or terminal phase, even if they may have the effect of shortening life". To clarify the distinction between acting and refraining from acting, and between acting and ceasing to act, we can refer to the intentions of the agent: the intention to cause death, which constitutes "active" euthanasia, differs from the intention of the person who refrains from continuing a treatment deemed unnecessary or harmful, and therefore excessive, a situation of unreasonable, disproportionate obstinacy, known as "therapeutic overkill", and condemned by the principle of non-maleficence. This distinction means that the term "euthanasia" is reserved for the "active", full, deliberate intention to end a life, an act that is criminal according to the law and reprobated by traditional medical ethics, which are still upheld by medical institutions and authorities. And room is made for the possible legitimacy, in certain circumstances, of an act which, even if it shortens life, no longer fights against an inescapable death and aims "first and foremost" to relieve suffering, and will no longer be qualified as euthanasia for this reason.  The main justification for drawing a line between euthanasia and non-euthanasia is to distinguish the intended effect of an act from its foreseeable but unintended side-effects. This is the "double effect" argument that inspired the 2005 law on the end of life, revised in 2016. According to this argument, the undesirable, "bad" consequences of an action that is considered to be primarily "good" do not necessarily prevent that action from being taken. For example, it is possible to relieve the suffering of an incurable patient at the end of life, even if the intensive administration of painkillers hastened the patient's death. The spirit of the principle of double effect is to say that while we can never will evil, even for the sake of a good, we can nevertheless will a good even if the result is evil, when the aim of this good is deemed to take priority. The aim of the primary good is imposed despite the evil that will be its effect. The advantage is to get out of a moral conflict between opposing duties: to relieve suffering, to protect life. In this way, we can say that there is no such thing as "euthanasia" because the desire is in no way to cause death, but to relieve a sick person in a proportionate way. Death, the foreseeable but unintended consequence of the act, remains secondary to the main aim, which is to avoid suffering in the final moments. Monotheistic religions therefore accept the relief of suffering at the end of life, even if life is shortened. Thanks to the double effect argument, the principle of respect for life can be made more flexible and become compatible with a concern for quality of life.

# Respecting the wishes of people at the end of their lives

The option for patients to write down their advance directives, i.e. their wishes regarding "the end of their life as regards the conditions for continuing, limiting, stopping or refusing medical treatment or procedures", has existed since the 2005 law. The main new feature of the 2016 law is that it is now binding.

The Clayes-Léonetti law provides for "advance directives and the designation of a trusted support person" to enable people who are no longer able to express their wishes to have their rights recognised. Advance directives become the preferred expression of the wishes of patients who are no longer able to express themselves. "Any person of legal age may draw up advance directives in the event that they are one day unable to express their wishes. These advance directives express the wishes of the person in relation to the end of their life as regards the conditions for continuing, limiting, stopping or refusing medical treatment or procedures. "They may be revised and revoked at any time and by any means.

Advance directives are now ''binding'' on doctors. "When a person, in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease, whatever the cause, is unable to express his wishes, the doctor is obliged to enquire about the expression of the patient's wishes. In the absence of the advance directives referred to in article L. 1111-11, the doctor shall obtain the testimony of the trusted support person or, failing this, any other testimony from the family or close friends". "Advance directives are binding on the doctor for any decision to carry out an investigation, intervention or treatment, except in the event of a life-threatening emergency, for the time necessary for a full assessment of the situation, and when the advance directives appear manifestly inappropriate or not in keeping with the medical situation". Some people, including palliative care professionals, stress the variability of wishes and, consequently, the difficulty of interpreting and applying advance directives drawn up in previous circumstances that are far removed from the current end-of-life situation. "The decision to refuse to apply advance directives that the doctor deems to be manifestly inappropriate or inconsistent with the patient's medical situation is taken at the end of a collegiate procedure defined by regulation and is recorded in the medical record. It is brought to the attention of the trusted support person designated by the patient or, failing that, to the attention of the family or close friends.

The "trusted support person" "may be a relative, a close friend or the doctor treating the patient". "His/her testimony prevails over any other testimony. This designation is made in writing and co-signed by the designated person. It may be reviewed and revoked at any time.

Conclusion. Fortunately, the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy limits the will to power that can arise from the implementation of treatments to prolong the life of a person at the end of life, at the cost of objectification, physical and/or moral suffering and disregard for that person's (previous or current) wishes. The right given to people at the end of their lives to ensure that their wishes are respected by means of advance directives rightly reinforces the limits to this abuse.

However, the end of life calls for anticipation as much as it resists it. Paradoxically, it is marked by a fear of the future, synonymous with death, and yet by the impossibility of not projecting oneself into the next day, or even the next moment, in the hope of living it as serenely and intensely as possible. From then on, care at the end of life consists of offering, through attentive and solicitous relationships, adaptive, day-to-day support aimed at living in the present, without succumbing to the vain temptation to control the future.
