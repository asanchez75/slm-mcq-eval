|Order=27}}In France, under the terms of the law resulting from the so-called bioethics laws, the examination of a person's genetic characteristics may only be undertaken for medical or scientific research purposes. This is the most common case, and it meets clinical objectives. There is also the special case of the use of genetics to identify a person: genetic fingerprinting.

= I Special case of identification of a person by genetic fingerprinting = This may be the case, for example, in forensic medicine, in order to identify the body of a deceased person, or for a paternity search.
This may be the case, for example, in forensic medicine, in order to identify the body of a deceased person, or for a paternity search.

Under the terms of the law, identification can only be sought in three contexts.

== A First Framework ==


Firstly, identification may be sought as part of an investigation or enquiry carried out in the course of legal proceedings or for the purpose of establishing the identity of a deceased person when the person's identity is unknown.

Genetic fingerprint identification can only be carried out on the instructions of a magistrate and in a laboratory approved for this purpose. In addition, they may only be carried out by natural or legal persons registered on a list of experts.

The individual's express consent must be obtained in writing before the identification is carried out, after the individual has been duly informed of its nature and purpose.

Unless the person gives their express consent during their lifetime, no identification by genetic fingerprinting can be carried out after their death.

The premises used for storing seals, biological samples and test results must be equipped with facilities to ensure :

* protection against theft or damage;
* absolute confidentiality;
* protection of seals, samples and test results.

== B Second frame


Secondly, identification may be sought through so-called paternity tests, carried out during legal proceedings.

These tests are only authorised as part of legal proceedings to establish or contest parentage and/or to obtain or withdraw subsidies.

The presumed father's consent is required (consent obtained expressly beforehand). The paternity test is ordered by a judge of the Tribunal de Grande Instance. Conducting a paternity test outside this framework is illegal.

The test is carried out using two methods: comparative examination of blood samples and identification by genetic fingerprinting. The conditions governing the locations and persons authorised to carry out these tests are based on the same approval rules as those mentioned above.

== C Third frame


Lastly, identification may be sought under the terms of the French National Defence Code, i.e. to identify people who have died in combat, people captured by the armed forces, or people for whom there are specific and serious reasons to believe that they pose a threat to the security of the armed forces or civilian populations.

When the identity search concerns a member of the armed forces who has died during an operation conducted by the armed forces, a victim of a natural disaster, or a person whose death is presumed to be the subject of security-related research, samples for the purpose of collecting the biological traces of this person may be taken in places that this person is likely to have frequented habitually, with the agreement of the person in charge of the premises or, if this person refuses or if it is impossible to obtain this agreement, with the authorisation of the liberty and custody judge of the district court. Samples for the same purposes may also be taken from the ascendants, descendants or presumed collateral relatives of this person. The express consent of each person concerned is then obtained in writing before the sample is taken, after they have been duly informed of the nature of the sample, its purpose and the fact that their consent may be revoked at any time. The consent must state the purpose of the sampling and identification.

= II The most common case of examination of a person's genetic characteristics in the context of healthcare or medical research = When identification is carried out for medical or scientific research purposes, the person's express consent must be obtained in writing before the identification is carried out.
When the identification is carried out for medical or scientific research purposes, the person's express consent must be obtained in writing before the identification is carried out, after the person has been duly informed of its nature and purpose. The consent must state the purpose of the identification. It may be revoked without formality at any time.

The purpose of this analysis is to :

* either to establish, confirm or rule out the diagnosis of a genetic disease in a person ;
* search for the characteristics of one or more genes likely to be at the origin of the development of a disease in a person or in the members of his or her family potentially concerned (enabling, for example, the implementation of a genetic counselling approach aimed at developing a prevention, screening or care programme for a person and possibly his or her relatives);
* or to adapt the medical treatment of a person according to their genetic characteristics (in particular targeted therapies, for example in cancerology according to the genetic characteristics of the tumour).

The prescription and performance of an examination of a person's genetic characteristics for medical purposes, as well as the specific procedures for appropriate genetic consultations, are governed by rules of good practice defined by order of the Minister for Health. These rules are as follows:

* the requirement for the patient's initial consent, obtained in writing and preceded by full information on the objectives, consequences and limitations of the test;
* the fact that the person may refuse to be informed of the result of the genetic test;
* the fact that the person is obliged to inform the members of his or her family in the event of the diagnosis of a serious genetic anomaly likely to require preventive or therapeutic measures (this is known as informing relatives). The law also specifies that if the person does not wish to inform the members of their family themselves, they may ask the doctor who carried out the examination to provide this information, while preserving the patient's anonymity.

There is one particular situation in which the tests are part of a couple's pregnancy plan. There are two possible situations in which tests may be carried out:

* to carry out a diagnosis on the foetus in utero: this is known as prenatal diagnosis (PND), the aim of which is to detect a particularly serious condition before birth, so that the parents can be offered treatment for the unborn child, or help them prepare to welcome the child, or in some cases to terminate the pregnancy;
* before the embryo is implanted: this is known as pre-implantation diagnosis (PGD). This technique only concerns couples at high risk of a serious and incurable genetic disease, who use medically assisted procreation, in this case in vitro fertilisation (IVF), to achieve their pregnancy plans. The principle is to identify healthy embryos during IVF, so that embryos carrying the disease are not transferred in utero. In France, only around fifty couples undergo this procedure each year.

= III Discussion of the ethical issues involved in predictive genetics =

== A Prediction: a major impact on life, liberty and fundamental human rights ==


Predictive testing is far from a neutral medical act: the result is either a 'conviction' or a 'release'.

Presymptomatic genetic diagnosis can be beneficial when, if abnormality(ies) are revealed, earlier monitoring, screening and treatment can be proposed to limit the expression of the disease and its severity (e.g. more frequent mammograms, MRI, colonoscopies, in familial forms of breast, ovarian or colon cancer).

The test also has a real benefit for potential carriers, when the test results come back normal, i.e. with no different risk from the general population, thus sparing them the inconvenience of regular, painful and anxiety-provoking monitoring.

However, for certain diseases, the medical benefit of pre-symptomatic diagnosis appears to be nil, given the current state of knowledge, in terms of the health of the individual who has undergone the test, as there is no treatment that can prevent or delay the onset of symptoms.

However, the benefit can be assessed in other ways:

* a direct individual benefit other than medical (ability to act and make decisions about the course and organisation of one's life);
* a social benefit (preparation for the illness and adjustment of working conditions);
* a family benefit (reorganisation of the family plan, dynamics of the couple in the face of the result, possibility of informing the children and other members of the family who may also be affected).

In all cases, in the context of a parental project, knowledge of the risk borne by the couple and potentially transmissible to a child has a major impact on the way in which the couple organise and medicalise this pregnancy project, and whether or not to continue it. The discovery of foetal anomalies can change the way the pregnancy or birth is managed, and can sometimes lead to discussions about whether or not to continue the pregnancy.

Questions arise on several levels:

* first level: this focuses on the effect of this information on the individual himself and on his relationships with those around him, and brings into play one of the major principles of bioethics: the autonomy of the subject, i.e. his ability to determine his own life freely. Will this predictive information be able to give individuals greater freedom or, on the contrary, will it lock them into a future that they can only endure? This question remains open;
* second level: this relates to the risk of information being used by third parties to discriminate in social life, with a risk of weakening social cohesion, justice and solidarity. This can have repercussions in terms of fears of exclusion (professional, family, insurance, etc.) There is therefore a major risk that such information will be misused if it leaves the sphere of the doctor-patient relationship and medical confidentiality. The confidentiality that underpins the contract of care between doctor and patient is an imperative here, as elsewhere. We shall see, however, that there can be a strong tension between the strict respect for confidentiality that may be desired by the person in whom a mutation has been discovered and the possible, sometimes major, interest of other genetically related family members in knowing this information for their own personal benefit. This is the subject of today's debate on the question of informing relatives.

For all these reasons, our law provides a framework for this practice, to ensure respect for fundamental human rights:

* the explicit consent of the individual is required;
* use is strictly limited to the medical sphere;
* medical confidentiality must be respected.

Multidisciplinary teams wishing to carry out pre-symptomatic diagnoses must have clinical and genetic expertise and be registered with the Agence de biomédecine.

The rules of good practice concerning genetic testing highlight the ethical principles that must be respected:

* respect for the individual and his or her autonomy, which implies that the applicant is of full age, voluntary, not subject to any pressure or influence from a third party, and in full intellectual capacity. The person is free not to know if this is their choice: this choice must be respected in all circumstances;
* respect for the applicant's freedom, based on an informed and enlightened choice, authenticated by the signature of his/her consent after objective and up-to-date information from the doctors, and by his/her understanding of the disease, its prognosis, the biological test, its limits and his/her anticipation of the individual and family psychological implications that this test could have, requiring time for reflection;
* the principle of justice and equality, i.e. that the test should be accessible to everyone without bias. The principle of justice also guarantees non-discrimination; this is achieved through professional secrecy, which is a general guideline in medicine, and a vital principle in the context of genetics, especially as it involves not just an individual but an entire family. This means ensuring that this information is not used by third parties, such as insurers or employers;
* the principle of beneficence (the person must be able to benefit from the test) or non-maleficence, with the doctor's concern not to harm the person. This harmful aspect is possible when, beyond an announcement, there is no prevention or cure available. This raises the question of the right not to know.

== B The collective dimension of genetic data and the ethical issues involved in informing relatives ==


In the case of genetic diseases, information about the risk does not just concern the person who has undergone the test and knows the result. It may also concern other genetically related family members, because if they are also carriers, they and their doctor can decide on appropriate measures.

Not receiving such information may be perceived as a loss of opportunity. Silence (i.e. the absolute preservation of medical secrecy) towards relatives of a person carrying a genetic disease for which preventive or curative measures exist raises first and foremost the question of moral responsibility towards others.

This question raises the question of who owns genetic medical information, given that it may reflect the state of health of several individuals in addition to a single source patient. The question is therefore whether genetic information remains strictly personal or individual data.

A dilemma or conflict of interest arises when the protection of a fundamental individual right (the right to secrecy) runs counter to the interests of others. This is the debate between individual and collective responsibility, and the doctor is at the heart of this debate, since he is acting in the interests of his patient, but also in the collective interest, as a player in prevention and public health.

The value of knowing about the condition affecting one of the family members lies in the fact that for certain diseases (e.g. cancer, metabolic diseases, etc.), there are preventive treatments or monitoring with early diagnosis that can prevent the onset of the disease or improve the individual's prognosis, or even in some cases prevent death. The disclosure of information covered by medical confidentiality may therefore be justified.

This process of disclosure is designed to achieve a benevolent medical objective, with the aim of improving the health of individuals; it is easy to subscribe to as long as the patient is well informed and supports it.

A woman carrying a genetic risk, for example of breast cancer, may wish to reveal certain information to members of her family, but this may also be difficult for her for various reasons. She may be unwilling or unable to disclose to others because of complex family histories, breakdowns or psychological or socio-behavioural impossibilities. It should be emphasised here that the greater the number of people to be contacted, the greater the complexity for the patient. Some people do not want to announce the misfortune of others ("the bird of ill omen"). Others have doubts about the willingness of others to receive this information. As a result, contacting family members yourself with a sensitive health announcement can be an impossible task.

Changes in the bioethics laws have enabled progress to be made in these situations. The doctor may disclose certain information with the patient's consent, but only under certain conditions.


Prior to carrying out an examination of a person's genetic characteristics, the prescribing doctor shall inform the person of the risks that silence would entail for the members of his or her family potentially concerned if a serious genetic anomaly were diagnosed, the consequences of which are likely to require preventive measures, including genetic counselling, or care. In a written document, the doctor and the person concerned agree how the potentially affected family members are to be informed. If the person does not wish to inform the family members potentially concerned themselves, they may ask the prescribing doctor, in a written document attesting to this request, to provide this information. To this end, the patient provides the doctor with the contact details of those concerned. The doctor then informs them of the existence of medical information of a family nature which may concern them and invites them to attend a genetic consultation, without disclosing the name of the person who has undergone the examination, the genetic anomaly or the associated risks.

These provisions follow on from opinion no. 76 of 24 April 2003 of the French National Consultative Ethics Committee (CCNE), which reiterated the need for strict respect for medical confidentiality while informing patients of the risks they would be exposing their family members to by remaining silent. These guidelines provide a response to some of the difficulties outlined above, and help patients in the always delicate process of informing their families.


Key points

It is only possible to identify a person by genetic fingerprinting:

* as part of an investigation or enquiry carried out in the course of legal proceedings,
* for medical or scientific research purposes,
* for the purpose of establishing the identity of deceased persons when the identity is unknown,
* under the conditions set out in article L.2381-1 of the French Defence Code.

Unless the person gives their express consent during their lifetime, no identification by genetic fingerprint can be carried out after their death.

In the case of a genetic disease, the doctor prescribing a genetic characteristics test informs the patient of the risks that silence would entail for potentially affected family members.

Together with the patient, the doctor will draw up a written document setting out the arrangements for providing information to family members who may be affected.
