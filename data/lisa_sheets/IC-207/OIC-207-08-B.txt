Atelectasis is a collapse of the lung parenchyma, of a segment, a lobe or the entire lung.

Atelectasis is most often of bronchial origin, secondary to endo-luminal, mural or extrinsic obstruction of a bronchus, usually of large diameter. Atelectasis can also be passive (pulmonary collapse on contact with a pleural effusion or ascension of the diaphragmatic dome, for example) or due to coiling (secondary to pleural thickening).

Atelectasis of bronchial origin is manifested on chest X-ray by ''a direct sign and indirect signs''.

#Direct sign'': opacity corresponding to a retracted lung, with a reduction in volume of the affected area. This opacity has the following characteristics
#*Systematised with sharp edges. In lobar atelectasis, the shape of the opacity varies according to the lobe affected, but is most often triangular with a hilar apex.
#*No aeriform bronchogram.
#Indirect signs: corresponding to the consequences of the reduction in volume of the affected area.
#*Scissural displacement, becoming concave towards the healthy parenchyma
#*Attraction of adjacent anatomical structures such as the trachea, heart and hilum
#*Ascension of the homolateral diaphragmatic dome
#*Possible compensatory hyperinflation of adjacent territories

Chest X-rays are frequently used to detect atelectasis of bronchial origin. A profile X-ray, in addition to a frontal X-ray, is often used to confirm and localise atelectasis. A thoracic CT scan is indicated to "specify the site of the obstruction" (endoluminal, wall or extrinsic) "and its nature" (foreign body, tumour, etc.).

File:Atel1.JPG|'''Figure 1'''. A. Diffuse homogeneous opacity of the left lung field, without aeriform bronchogram, associated with left tracheal deviation (white arrow) and ascension of the left diaphragmatic dome (black arrow) on chest radiograph. B. Mediastinal deviation secondary to atelectasis of the left lung ("P"), with evidence of an endoluminal lesion of the left main bronchus on chest CT with contrast injection. Primary bronchial tumour.
File:Atel2.JPG|'''Figure 2.''' A. Homogeneous systematised retrocardiac opacity of the left lower lobe (black arrow) on chest radiograph, roughly triangular in shape with hilar apex. Left deviation of the cardiac silhouette (white arrow). B. Corresponding paravertebral opacity (arrow) showing complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
File:Atel3.JPG|'''Figure 3.''' A. Systematised homogeneous opacity of the right upper lobe with displacement of the small scissure, ascending. The scissure has a concave edge towards the healthy lung in its lateral portion (black arrow), and a more convex edge above the right lobe (white arrow). This is atelectasis of the right upper lobe, secondary to the presence of a suprahelical mass. The suprahilar mass is responsible for the convex medial contour of the atelectasis. B. Illustration on the same radiograph of both the concave and convex appearance of the scissure, a consequence of the presence of a tumour mass (in blue): this is Golden's "S" sign (in black).
