- Migraine = '''neurovascular pathology''' linked to subtle neuronal and vascular alterations. The mechanisms are still incompletely understood.


- Migraines come in two varieties:

o ''Migraine without aura (MSA)'': 6-10% of the population

o ''Migraine with aura'' in which the headache is preceded or accompanied by transient neurological symptoms (3-6% of the population).


- Migraine disease is a neurovascular pathology:

o ''Polygenic hereditary'': multiple susceptibility genes induce cerebral hyperexcitability and dysfunction of cephalic nociception modulator centres.

o ''Environmental factors: pathology of adaptation to change'': internal or external triggers that disrupt cerebral homeostasis: changes to meals or sleep, unusual physical effort, climatic changes, catamenial period, stress or positive or negative emotion.

o '''Young people''': 90% of attacks begin under the age of 40, migraine rare over the age of 65.

o ''Predominantly female'': after puberty, oestrogen impregnation increases cerebral excitability, and variations during the cycle make attacks more likely. Migraines typically improve during pregnancy and after the menopause.

o '''Paroxysmal and cyclic with 5 phases'': prodrome, aura, headache, post-drome and interictal phase


- ''Prodromes: activation of the hypothalamus'', can last up to 48 hours before the headache, leads to a lifting of inhibition of the brainstem and trigeminovascular system.

- '''Migraine aura''': wave of '''pervasive cortical depression''' (PCD) with moderate vasoconstriction.

- Migraine headache caused by activation of the trigemino-vascular system and a major role for CGRP (calcitonin-gene related peptide) with perivascular and meningeal aseptic inflammation and moderate vasodilation.
