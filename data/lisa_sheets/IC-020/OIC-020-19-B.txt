'''Nested case-control study''': a case-control study in which cases and controls are selected from subjects in a cohort that has already been established. Subjects who developed the event of interest during follow-up are included as "cases" and subjects who did not develop the event after an equivalent length of follow-up are included as "controls". These cases and controls can be re-contacted to collect data retrospectively on more specific exposures that were not collected prospectively as part of the cohort, without having to re-contact all the subjects in the initial cohort.

'''Case-cohort study''': From an existing cohort, a sample called the ''sub-cohort'' is selected at random (i.e. representative of the entire cohort). All the incident 'cases' in the cohort (all the individuals who have experienced the event of interest, whether or not from the sub-cohort) are selected and compared with the 'non-cases' in the sub-cohort only. This scheme is used in particular when the study requires additional data to be collected. In order to avoid collecting data on the entire initial cohort, only cases (from the entire cohort) and "non-cases" (from the sub-cohort) are collected. For example: association between a genetic anomaly and the occurrence of cancer (the genetic anomaly will only be measured in cancer cases and non-cases in the sub-cohort).

'''Quasi-experimental study''': we speak of quasi-experimental studies when the objective is to evaluate the effect on a judgment criterion of an experimental intervention, conducted on an individual or population scale, i.e. administered to all or some of the subjects in a population or sample as part of a study, <u>outside a randomised trial.</u> In practice:

* <u>No control group,</u> for example in:
** a '''repeated cross-sectional before/after survey'' design of an intervention conducted on an experimental basis in a population in order to compare the prevalence of the event of interest between the two periods. The problem is the possible existence of a period effect: we do not know how this prevalence changes over the same period for a population where the intervention was not administered.
** a ''cohort'' design in which all the subjects included receive an experimental intervention on inclusion, or during follow-up, and in which the incidence rate of the event of interest, or its evolution ''before/after'' the intervention, is studied in an almost descriptive manner; this incidence rate may be compared with known rates in the source population.

* <u>Control group but not determined by drawing lots,</u> for example in :
** A '''here-elsewhere study'' design in which prevalences or incidence rates of the event of interest are compared (by single or repeated cross-sectional surveys, or as part of cohort surveys) between geographical regions, some of which are selected (but not drawn at random) to receive an intervention on an experimental basis in a population ;
** A ''cohort survey'' design in which some of the subjects (not selected at random) are selected to receive an experimental intervention.

'''Study on grouped (=aggregated) data''': we do not know the individual status of the health phenomenon of interest but we can estimate its ''frequency'' at the level of a group of subjects (defined for example on a geographical criterion: region, country...). This is the case when we have a registration system which lists all the subjects who have developed the event of interest during a given period in a given population (e.g. cancer registry, notifiable diseases, etc. see [[Data collection 2C-020-DE-B05]]). To estimate the frequency of the event of interest in this population, we can use census data, for example, which will give us the total size of the population over the period for the denominator. These frequencies can be compared between several populations or over time. When different recording systems are available to estimate the frequency of the event of interest and that of exposure factors in groups of subjects, it is also possible to compare the joint changes in these frequencies over time or space. Example: estimate changes in the age- and sex-standardised cancer incidence rate in France between 1990 and 2020 using cancer registries, compare these incidence rates between different regions, study the correlation between changes in these incidence rates and changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption over the same period.
