==Questioning and clinical examination should enable a distinction to be made between:==

*enlargement of the bursa: painful (torsion, orchi-epididymitis, scrotal trauma) and non-painful (inguinal hernia, hydrocele and cord cyst, testicular tumours, testicular cancer 313, varicocele)
*''a testicular migration disorder'' (cryptorchidism)
*'''anomalies of the penis'' (penis): phimosis (congenital or acquired), paraphimosis, cancer of the penis, discolouration of the penis (congenital or acquired)
*anomalies of the urethral meatus (stenosis, hypospadias, epispadias)

=='''Painful enlargement of the bursae''' should be considered as:==

*Spermatic cord torsion'': any acute painful bursa is a spermatic cord torsion until proven otherwise, whatever the age. Spermatic cord torsion is manifested by acute, intense, unilateral, sudden scrotal pain, usually nocturnal. The pain is continuous, with no analgesic position, and radiates towards the inguinal region, along the spermatic cord towards the iliac fossa. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. When questioning the patient, it is important to find out when the symptoms began. The bursa is painful, enlarged, sometimes red and warm. During lifting manoeuvres, the bursa remains painful (negative Prehn's sign). The testicle is elevated and retracted at the inguinal ring. The cremasteric reflex is absent.
*''Orchiepididymitis'': Before puberty and after the age of 35, orchiepididymitis is usually associated with urinary tract infections in children and adults (urogenital infections 161) and sexually transmitted infections (STI): gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), trichomoniasis (trichomoniasis 162). From puberty to the age of 35, orchi-epididymitis is frequently secondary to a sexually transmitted infection. The clinical presentation of orchi-epididymitis is painful enlargement of a bursa. It may be associated with a progressive fever, or more rarely a sudden onset. Its intensity varies according to the pathogen, and the pain is associated with local signs of varying intensity: scrotal pain radiating along the cord, progressive and not sudden onset (as opposed to torsion of the spermatic cord), painful induration of the cord and all or part of the epididymis. The scrotum is inflamed. Lifting the testicle usually relieves the pain (positive Prehn's sign), making it possible to distinguish torsion. Any doubt about the diagnosis of torsion of the spermatic cord (particularly in the absence of general signs and functional urinary signs) should lead to surgical exploration to rule out torsion.
*''Scrotal trauma''': Most often, this is a young patient who, following direct perineal or scrotal trauma, presents with acute, intense scrotal pain. There may be nausea and vomiting. Clinical examination reveals a large non-inflammatory bursa (haematocele: blood in the vaginal cavity), with a scrotal haematoma. Transillumination is negative (haematocele), but clinical examination is often difficult because of the severity of the pain. It is therefore impossible to assess the integrity of the testicle. Several types of lesion may be found:
**Scrotal haematoma (rare)
**Intra-testicular haematoma
**Haematocele: blood effusion inside the vaginal cavity. It is the result of testicular rupture.
**Testicular contusion: the albuginea is intact and there is no intra-testicular haematoma.
**Testicular fracture: there is a rupture of the albuginea with exit of the testicular pulp into the vaginal cavity.
**Lesions of the testicular appendages (epididymis or spermatic cord): lesions of the epididymis are rare and the cord is most often respected by the trauma due to its mobility.

==A painless, enlarged bursa should prompt the diagnosis of:==

*''Testicular cancer'' ([[Testicular tumours|item 313]]): Testicular cancers occur in young men (aged 15-35). Cryptorchidism is the main risk factor for testicular cancer. Testicular cancer is discovered in the following circumstances: autopalpation, infertility test, gynaecomastia, prevalent metastasis. The testicle is hard, stony, irregular and not very sensitive. The tumour markers are: alpha-feto-protein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). Biopsy is contraindicated and diagnosis is made by inguinal orchiectomy.
*An inguinal or inguino-scrotal hernia is a painless swelling of the groin fold (unless strangulated), which can be reduced when coughing.
*A hydrocele is the accumulation of intravaginal serous fluid between the testicle and its vaginal envelope. The clinical presentation is that of an enlarged, painless bursa. Questioning may reveal variations in volume during the day, particularly in children (communicating hydrocele secondary to the persistence of a permeable peritoneo-vaginal canal). Positive transillumination confirms the diagnosis.
*In adults, the hydrocele is non-communicating and linked to an anomaly of the vagina. The hernial orifices are free.
*A cord cyst'': the clinical presentation of a cord cyst is that of a regular painless swelling, suspended above and independent of the testicle, without pain.
*''A varicocele'': A varicocele is the varicose dilatation of the veins of the pampiniform plexus of the cord. A varicocele may be discovered during a systematic examination, an isolated deformity of the scrotum, a functional symptom such as discomfort, heaviness, especially when standing or during intense or prolonged physical effort, often relieved by decubitus, as part of an assessment of male infertility, or very rarely associated with local complications: non-traumatic rupture or thrombophlebitis. Inspection in the standing position may reveal a deformity of the posterior and upper part of the scrotum, of varying size, behind the testicle and along the cord, which diminishes with decubitus. Palpation reveals a varicose swelling that is impulsive on coughing and increases in volume on exhalation with the glottis closed (Valsalva manoeuvre), and whose consistency is sometimes compared to that of a "bag of worms". Varicocele is common and even normal in young pubescent adolescents on the left side (blood reflux from the left renal vein into the left gonadal vein). A varicocele should be considered suspicious on the right side or of recent onset [[Neoplasms of the kidney|(kidney cancer 311]]), compressive adenopathy, venous thrombosis). In this case, imaging (ultrasound or abdominal CT or MRI) is recommended.

=='''Cryptorchidism''': is defined as a testicle spontaneously and permanently located outside the scrotum, at any point along the normal path of testicular migration. Cryptorchidism excludes:==

*oscillating or ascending testicles, which may descend spontaneously into the scrotum and which, in young boys, hyperactivity of the cremaster causes to ascend to the superficial inguinal ring
*ectopic testicles, which are located at a point outside the normal path of testicular migration. The location may be perineal, femoral, pubo-penile or contralateral intra-scrotal. Ectopia may be observed in cases of scrotal trauma (dislocation).
*The examination should be carried out gently, with warm hands and the child lying supine, thighs apart and legs half-bent, so as to achieve complete muscle relaxation. The inguino-scrotal region is palpated with both hands, the upper hand pressing firmly on the abdominal wall to bring the gonad downwards while the lower hand moves upwards from the scrotum. When the cryptorchid testicle can be palpated, its position, both spontaneously and after manipulation, its volume and consistency must be specified. The testicle may be normal or atrophic and soft. If examination of the inguino-scrotal region is negative, the testicle should be sought in an ectopic position. Following a complete examination, several clinical situations may arise:
**Unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism with palpable testicles (80% of cases)
**Non-palpable testicles (20% of cases)
**Bilateral cryptorchidism with non-palpable testicles: An endocrine investigation and a karyotype should be performed to rule out anorchidism or a sexual differentiation disorder.

=='''Anomalies of the penis''' are:==

*Phimosis'': phimosis is defined as a relative stenosis of the preputial orifice which prevents complete retraction of the skin behind the glans. It is physiological in children up to the age of 5. When it appears in adulthood, it must be considered pathological (scleratrophic lichen, cancer of the penis, unbalanced diabetes mellitus).
*Paraphimosis: this is a complication of phimosis. It is secondary to forced retraction of the preputial ring with forgetfulness or inability to recalibrate. In the absence of recalibration, oedema of the prepuce and glans will form and create a constriction in the balanopreputial groove.
*'''Penile thickening''': This is noticeable during erection. In children (congenital curvature), it is noticed either by the parents, or by a doctor during a systematic examination or by the adolescent. In most cases, it is associated with hypospadias. In adults, it is secondary to fibrous plaques of the corpora cavernosa (Lapeyronie's disease item 126), which are painful in the initial phase and then painless. It can be the cause of erectile dysfunction item 126.
*Cancer of the penis'': this is a squamous cell cancer, affecting adult men (> 50 years old). Favouring factors are pre-cancerous lesions (erythroplasia), lichen sclero-atrophic, HPV infections and lack of circumcision. It sits on the sheath of the penis or the foreskin. It may present as acquired phimosis or an indurated, ulcerated, painless, vegetating and progressive lesion of the penis. The 1st lymph node is inguinal.

==''Urethral meatus anomalies''':==

*'''<small>Urethral meatus stenosis:</small>''' In the vast majority of cases, it is secondary (repair of an abnormal meatus, circumcision). Congenital stenosis will be due to a channeling defect of the balanic urethra. In adults, it is secondary to chronic inflammation or scleratrophic lichen. It may be revealed by dysuria, [[Disorders of micturition and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|chronic urinary retention (item 125)]) sometimes with renal failure, [[Disorders of micturition and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|urinary incontinence (125)]] (child), or [[Urinary infections in children and adults|urinary infections (161)]]. On examination the meatus is punctiform and fibrous.
*<small>'''Hypospadias:'''</small> a hypospadias is defined by a urethral meatus which, instead of being located at the apex of the glans (navicular fossa), is located all along the course of the urethra, bulbar, penile or balanic (most common), on the ventral surface of the penis or on the perineum, behind the bursae. The foreskin is not closed ventrally and has the classic "sapper's apron" appearance. In a certain number of cases, hypospadia is associated with penile discolouration. This discolouration can only be observed during erection. Hypospadia is purely functional and aesthetic and does not lead to urinary signs or erectile dysfunction. Fertility is normal.
*<small>'''Epispadias:'''</small> Epispadias is defined by the presence of the urethral meatus on the dorsal surface of the penis. This orifice may be located very proximally at the level of the bladder neck (penopubic or suprapubic, with bladder exstrophy) or more distally (penile) as far as the dorsal surface of the glans (balanic), which then takes the form of 2 hemiglands separated by a longitudinal groove open dorsally. The penis, which is of normal calibre, is short and curved towards the abdominal wall: a sort of dorsal curvature of the penis. They are associated with a spread of the pubis and rectus abdominis muscles to varying degrees. Epispadias may be observed in cases of bladder exstrophy. Urinary continence disorders and erectile dysfunction may occur in cases of associated anomalies of the penis.
