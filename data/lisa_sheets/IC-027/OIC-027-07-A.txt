Contamination of the foetus is transplacental and the rubella virus is teratogenic.

The risk of foetal infection varies with gestational age. Before 11 weeks' gestation, the incidence of foetal infection is around 90%. This frequency then decreases to 25% between 24 and 26 weeks' gestation, then increases again to reach 100% at the end of the pregnancy. If conception takes place after the rash, the risk of foetal infection is probably low, since the rash coincides with the appearance of antibodies and the end of viremia. When maternal infection occurs before 11 weeks' gestation, the risk of major foetal anomalies is very high (around 90%). After 18 weeks' gestation, the risk is virtually nil. Between 11 and 18 weeks' gestation, the frequency of abnormalities varies.

There are two situations

- '''Polymalformative syndrome''' including neurological anomalies (microcephaly), ophthalmic anomalies (cataracts, microphthalmia, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy, chorioretinitis), auditory anomalies (sensorineural deafness), cardiac anomalies (stenosis of the peripheral pulmonary artery, persistence of the ductus arteriosus or interventricular communication, etc.). It can be complicated by miscarriage or foetal death in utero;

- Progressive congenital rubella'' which corresponds to chronic generalised viral infection. It reflects the persistence of the virus in the blood, which may persist for several months: these newborns are highly contagious. This form may be asymptomatic, particularly in the case of maternal infection after 18 months' gestation. When it is symptomatic, growth retardation, thrombocytopenic purpura, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, convulsions and radiological bone abnormalities may be observed. These multi-visceral lesions may regress or leave sequelae. The long-term prognosis for congenital rubella that is symptomatic at birth is guarded, especially as regards psychomotor and auditory development.

The WHO defines congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and congenital rubella infection (CRI) as follows:

- A case of "CRS" is a child with 2 complications from group A (cataract and/or congenital glaucoma, congenital heart disease, sensorineural deafness, pigmentary retinopathy) or 1 from group A + one from group B (purpura, splenomegaly, microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, meningoencephalitis, bone mineralisation anomalies, early neonatal jaundice). The diagnosis can be confirmed by testing for specific IgM antibodies in the neonatal period.

- A case of ''CRI'' is a child who does not fit into the previous definition and who has positive specific IgM in the neonatal period.
