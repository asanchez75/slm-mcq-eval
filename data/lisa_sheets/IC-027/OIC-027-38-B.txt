Foetal damage is proportional to the quantity of alcohol ingested.

There are three main types of consumption, regardless of the type of drink involved (a drink containing approximately 10g of pure alcohol, whatever the alcohol):

- Heavy consumption: more than 2 drinks per day. The foetal impact is well documented, with a risk of FAS.

- Occasional, light or moderate consumption: around 1 to 2 drinks per day. There is no dysmorphic or malformative syndrome. In the case of occasional or light alcohol consumption, the scientific data are reassuring regarding the occurrence of long-term cognitive or behavioural problems. In the case of moderate drinking, studies are contradictory, but there is a risk of alteration in behavioural scores, as well as affective and/or anxiety disorders.

- Binge drinking: this is common in early pregnancy, when the pregnancy is still unknown. There is no proven impact of a binge drinking episode (≥ 4 drinks in one go) on the occurrence of foetal malformations or cognitive-behavioural disorders at this stage of pregnancy, provided that the episode remains isolated and is not repeated thereafter. Later on, during pregnancy - particularly in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters - acute alcohol consumption (5 drinks) can lead to cognitive problems as a result of impaired neuronal migration.
