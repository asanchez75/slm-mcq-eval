<br />'''Addiction:'''' a process by which a behaviour, capable of producing pleasure and/or warding off or alleviating a feeling of internal discomfort, is employed with "the repeated impossibility of controlling this behaviour and its continuation despite the knowledge of its negative consequences".

- consumption of psychoactive substances (substance addiction), or

- or another behaviour: ("non-substance addictions" or "behavioural addictions": gambling, video games, sex, internet, shopping, exercise).

Corresponds to dependency.


'''Non usage:''' absence of consumption.


'''Low-risk use:'''' Consumption of a substance or performance of a behaviour that is not pathological in nature.


'''High-risk use:''' levels of consumption that expose people to the risk of complications, either secondary to acute consumption (accidents or violence) or secondary to chronic consumption (physical, psychological or social complications, transition to dependence), but these complications are not yet present (and may never be).


'''Harmful use''': use of a psychoactive substance that is harmful to health. The complications may be physical or psychological, but without the criteria of dependence (the patient is unaware of the links between harm and consumption).


'''Dependence:''' a set of behavioural, cognitive and physiological phenomena in which the use of a psychoactive substance leads to a progressive loss of interest in other activities: corresponds to addiction.


'''Misuse:'''' Any use of psychoactive substances involving risk and/or harm and/or dependence. Includes risky use, harmful use and dependence.
