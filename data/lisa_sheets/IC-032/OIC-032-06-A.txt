# '''Parent-child bonding''' Parent-child bonding is the result of a maturative process that begins before birth and needs to be promoted during the first few days of life.  After birth, skin-to-skin contact with the mother should be encouraged if the condition of the newborn and the mother allow it. Early initiation of breastfeeding (within the first hour) should be offered if breastfeeding is desired. Clinical examinations and care of the newborn are carried out in the presence of the parents.  Staying in hospital after giving birth is a good opportunity to support the parents and learn how to care for the newborn. This period also provides an opportunity to observe the family and identify any psycho-social difficulties.
# Breastfeeding (Management of normal and difficult breastfeeding)  The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. Breastfeeding has many advantages: - a nutritional model adapted to physiological needs; - reduced risk of infection; - prevention of atopy; - contribution to the mother-child bond; - economic advantage.  Breastfeeding should begin early (within the first hour of life). The mother should be given information on :  - correct positioning of the newborn; - correct latching of the baby; - nipple hygiene; - stopping smoking and alcohol consumption; - the frequency and duration of feeds (breastfeeding on demand, 8 to 12 feeds); - assessing the effectiveness of breastfeeding (stools several times a day, copious urination, weight gain 200-250g per week);  - administration of vitamin K at 1 month of age and daily administration of vitamin D (1000 to 1200 IU); - complications of breastfeeding (insufficient lactation, sore and cracked nipples, engorgement, lymphangitis); - start of dietary diversification between 4 and 6 months of age.  Contraindications to breastfeeding are rare (maternal HIV infection, maternal heart or kidney disease, galactosemia in children, certain drugs).
# Regular medical check-ups (14 medical examinations during the first 3 years, including 1 in the first week, 1 in the second week and one a month until the child is 6 months old); - Preventive measures (unexpected infant death syndrome, transmission of infections, domestic accidents)'''(Prevention of [[Unexpected infant death syndrome : definitions 2C-345-DE-A01|unexplained death]] of infants, [[Prevention of domestic accidents SD-325|Prevention of domestic accidents]])'''; - Risks associated with passive smoking; - Prompt medical consultation in the event of fever before 3 months, eating difficulties, respiratory discomfort, diarrhoea, vomiting, unusual behaviour (''''[[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|Acute respiratory distress]]'''); - Vaccinations: check the parents' anti-pertussis vaccination and inform them of the child's vaccination schedule ('''[[Vaccinations for adults and children SD-322|Vaccinations]]] for adults and children)'''; - Sun protection; - Information on shaken baby syndrome ('''Suspicion [[Abuse and children at risk. Protection maternelle et infantile|maltraitance]] et enfance en danger)'''
# '''Leaving the maternity unit''' - Update of the health record (clinical examination, date of compulsory screening, diet chosen and discharge weight must be recorded); - Discharge prescription: vitamin supplementation (vitamin D+/- vitamin K), care of the umbilical cord until it falls off, diet; - Consultation by a paediatrician recommended during the second week of life; - Weekly weighing during the first month.
