The Social Security Financing Act lays down the general conditions for the financial equilibrium of the social security system and, in the light of revenue forecasts, sets expenditure targets. It is passed each year by parliament, following a government bill[1].   

The Social Security Financing Act (LFSS) is a category of law created by the revision of the Constitution on 22 February 1996. It "aims to control social and health spending". It determines the conditions necessary for the financial equilibrium of social security and sets expenditure targets based on revenue forecasts.

It should be emphasised that this is a ''financing law'' rather than a ''finance law'', which clearly indicates that the LFSS is not of the same nature as the State's finance laws; in particular, they have no budgetary scope. Parliamentary control therefore remains limited. Parliament does not have the power to set social security revenues itself. The LFSS does not authorise the collection of revenue, it merely forecasts it. Similarly, the expenditure targets voted by Parliament assess expenditure but do not limit it.

The LFSS is voted on by Parliament every year, at the same time as the Finance Act (LF) that determines the State budget. It must be submitted to the National Assembly by 15 October at the latest. Parliament must vote on it within 50 days, otherwise the PLFSS may be adopted by ordinance. It may also be amended during the year by an amending LFSS.

Since 1996, Parliament has had a say in the financial equilibrium of the social security system. It can give its opinion on the broad outlines of health and social security policies, as well as on the way they are financed.

Examples of new measures include extending paternity leave from 14 days to 28 days and making it compulsory for 7 days; increasing the salaries of hospital staff and those working in accommodation establishments for dependent elderly people (EHPAD); funding expenditure on tests, vaccines and masks to respond to the health crisis; and creating a 5th branch of social security to support independent living.
