'''Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment''''

This is a retinal detachment (RD) secondary to a retinal tear (from the Greek rhegma = tear), as opposed to exudative retinal detachments (as in hypertension or gestational toxaemia) and traction retinal detachments (in diabetic retinopathy in particular).

A tear in the peripheral retina may allow fluid to pass from the vitreous cavity into the subretinal space. This subretinal fluid (SRF) will lift the retina from close to close: this is DR.

A number of "factors" contribute to the occurrence of a DR:

*Age: idiopathic DR, linked to posterior physiological vitreous detachment in the elderly.
*Myopia, particularly severe myopia (myopia greater than -6 dioptres): the risk of rhegmatogenous DR increases with the degree of myopia;
*Cataract surgery (aphakic or pseudophakic DR), which is complicated by DR in around 2% of cases, with a variable delay, sometimes several years after the operation on the lens.
*Trauma
*Uveitis

The spontaneous course of the disease is very unfavourable: the DR inexorably spreads, encompassing the macula and then the entire retina. Within a few weeks, the detached retina suffers irreversible damage leading to blindness.

The ''suggestive clinical signs'' of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment are:

- myodesopsias followed by phosphenes corresponding to the onset of the retinal tear

- amputation of the peripheral visual field, corresponding to the formation of the DR

- when the DR lifts the macula, it causes a drop in visual acuity (white, painless eye).

A fundus examination, including examination of the peripheral retina, is used to:

*make the diagnosis: the retina appears raised, mobile, forming voluminous folds
*search for the causal tear: the surgeon must try to find several tears, as multiple tears are common and failure to identify one or more tears can lead to failure of the surgical treatment.

The ''treatment'' is solely ''surgical'': its principle is to seal the peripheral retinal tear, stopping the passage of LSR; the residual LSR is then resorbed by the pigment epithelium and choroid, allowing the retina to replicate. The anatomical (around 90% success rate) and functional prognosis of surgical treatment is better the earlier it is performed, especially when the macula is raised by the DR. DR is therefore considered a "semi-emergency", warranting surgery within a few days of diagnosis.
