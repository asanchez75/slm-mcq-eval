|Title=Knowing the organisation of care for rare diseases in France
|Description=When faced with unusual clinical signs and/or an incoherent set of symptoms, health professionals must become reflexively aware of the existence of a rare disease. The latest National Plan for Rare Diseases (PNMR3) sets the goal of having every patient diagnosed with a rare disease within 1 year. Every doctor should be aware of the highly structured national organisation, consisting of rare disease centres of reference (CRMRs) and rare disease health networks (FSMRs), which act as relays for the diagnosis of these diseases and promote clear healthcare pathways.

In line with the vision of the IRDiRC consortium (international consortium for research into rare diseases), the National Plan for Rare Diseases 3 (PNMR3) aims to ensure that all patients suffering from rare diseases have received a precise diagnosis one year after their first specialist medical consultation and can benefit from the care and therapies available. Patients without a precise diagnosis at the latest one year after the first specialist consultation are limited to those for whom the state of the scientific, medical and technical art does not allow a precise diagnosis to be made. These patients are then said to be at a diagnostic impasse. When faced with unusual clinical signs (e.g. symptoms at an earlier age than usual), and/or an incoherent set of symptoms, health professionals should make it a reflex to suggest a rare disease.

The national organisation is highly structured and is based on the following elements (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/soins-et-maladies/prises-en-charge-specialisees/maladies-rares/):

- '''Centres de référence maladies rares''' (CRMR): A CRMR is a "network" comprising a coordinating site, one or more constituent sites and, where appropriate, one or more centres of competence (CCMR) or resource and competence centres. They are responsible for coordination, expertise, referrals, research and training/education.

- A ''centre of competence'' (CCMR) ensures the care and follow-up of people suffering from rare diseases as close as possible to their home, on the basis of an adapted territorial network and in liaison with the CRMR on which it is functionally dependent.

- A ''rare disease health network'' (FSMR) is an organisation which coordinates a network of hospital care centres, diagnostic and research laboratories, social and medico-social structures, universities, associations, and any other partner or institution with complementary expertise in the field of rare diseases concerned.
