Strong opioids include sustained-release (SR) oral forms, which provide analgesia over a long period, and immediate-release (IR) forms, which are suitable for the initiation of treatment, emergencies, paroxysmal attacks of pain and pain induced by care.


'''<u>Main strong opioids</u>''''

- Morphine: morphine hydrochloride and morphine sulphate (subcutaneous, IM, IV, epidural and intrathecal), oral morphine sulphate: LP (12 h) and LI (4 h) forms adapted to the initiation of treatment, emergencies, paroxysmal attacks of pain (PAD) and iatrogenic pain (from treatment).

- Oxycodone, semi-synthetic agonist (oral forms (LP (12H) and LI (4H) and IV, SC).

- Fentanyl, synthetic opioid derivative

- available transdermally (72 h) (liposolubility) as a relay to a strong opioid for stable pain (not suitable for titration) with the possibility of inter-dose LI of morphine or oxycodone, including for ADP of cancer pain

- transmucosal route (onset of action 10 to 15 minutes and duration of action 1 to 2 hours): approved for PDA in patients already receiving stabilised background treatment with a strong opioid for cancer pain, up to a maximum of 4 doses per day.

- Hydromorphone (hydrochloride): semi-synthetic derivative, in oral form (LP only) indicated in cancer pain as a 2nd-line treatment in cases of resistance or intolerance to strong opioids.  

- Methadone: opioid mainly used as a replacement therapy for opioid dependence. Also approved for cancer pain after failure of other strong opioid analgesics.

- Buprenorphine: a partial agonist sometimes used to treat severe pain, particularly post-operative and neoplastic pain, but generally more often as a substitute for drug dependence (see methadone).


'''<u>Mechanism of action and classification</u>''''

- Binding to opioid receptors, particularly mu receptors in the brain, spinal cord and periphery

- Pure agonists: morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone, no ceiling analgesic effect (except buprenorphine and nalbuphine)

- Antagonists: treatment of opiate overdose naloxone (peripheral and CNS action) and adverse effects: naloxegol and methylnaltrexone (antagonists with peripheral action that do not pass the blood-meningeal barrier, if at all).

'''Notes on Table 1:'''

- A change of opioid or route of administration is a complex operation, requiring an estimate of the dosage of the new treatment, the safe implementation of the changeover and consideration of the kinetics of the galenics.

- The best strategy when switching is to calculate the safest possible dosage (even if it means underdosing), combined with titration with interdoses of fast-acting opioids.

'''<u>Undesirable effects</u>''''

- 1<sup>rst</sup> cause of poor compliance and premature discontinuation of treatment.

- More frequent in the ''elderly'' and in cases of ''renal insufficiency'': caution in these areas (low dosage and very gradual increase).
{| class="wikitable"
| colspan="3" |'''Table 4: Side effects of strong opioids, how to prevent or treat them'''
|-
| colspan="2" |'''Constipation'''
|High frequency, persistence over time (no tolerance).'''

Preventive treatment: dietary hygiene measures (physical activity, hydration, etc.) and "systematic oral laxatives"; 2nd line: peripherally acting antagonists (in the absence of contraindication).

Curative treatment: increase the dosage of laxatives, check for faecal impaction, rectal treatment, dual laxative therapy, rectal enema and peripheral morphine antagonist.
|-
| colspan="2" |'''Nausea and vomiting''''
|'''1/2 to 2/3 of patients: generally subsides in 2 to 3 weeks.'''

Preventive treatment: gastrokinetic anti-emetics from the start of treatment for 8 - 15 days.

Curative treatment: centrally-acting neuroleptics: haloperidol or low-dose chlorpromazine, corticosteroids, setrons or 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (off-label), IV droperidol if on IV morphine.

Look for another cause (metabolic disorders, intestinal obstruction, etc.).
|-
|'''Sleepiness''''
| colspan="2" |'''1<sup>er</sup> sign of opioid overdose''. Risk of falls in the elderly

Look for metabolic or iatrogenic causes (potentiation by psychotropic drugs), uncontrolled use of treatment

Action to be taken: reduce opioid doses or rotate opioids.

'''<u>Dependence and misuse of prescription opioids (Table 5)</u>''''
{| class="wikitable"
| colspan="2" |'''Table 5: Definitions and concepts of tolerance, dependence and misuse'''
<br />
|-
|'''Physical dependence''''
|Occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome when opioids are abruptly stopped or reduced too rapidly (sweating, muscle cramps, headache, asthenia, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, digestive disorders, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, dehydration, mydriasis).

May also occur in cases of tolerance before the next dose.
|-
|'''Tolerance'''
|'''Corresponds to an increase in the dose required to obtain the same pharmacological effect.'' May affect all the pharmacological effects of opioids apart from constipation.
|-
|Psychological dependence'' (addiction)
|Irrational and excessive use of opioids motivated by irrepressible cravings, with potential social, psychological or physical repercussions.

'''Patients at risk: history of abuse (alcohol, psychotropic drugs, illicit substances, opioids, etc.), psychiatric disorders, unstable psychosocial context.'''
|-
|'''Misuse''''
|Inappropriate use of medication by the patient.
|}
- '''Current increase in the frequency of psychological dependence and misuse in chronic non-cancer pain.'''

- '''Regular research is necessary for long-term prescriptions to identify factors suggestive of misuse or dependence'': rapid increase in doses without clinical explanation, non-compliance with the prescription, systematic refusal to consider other treatments, frequent overlapping, use of several prescribers, etc.

'''<u>Counter indications</u>'''

- Decompensated respiratory failure

- Severe hepatocellular insufficiency

- Uncontrolled epilepsy

- Head trauma and intracranial hypertension,

- Acute alcohol poisoning and delirium tremens,

- Combinations with MAOIs and combinations of agonists with agonist-antagonists or partial agonists.


'''<u>Conduct in the event of overdose</u>''''

- Signs: sedation, irregular breathing and decrease in respiratory rate (RR) < 10/ min.

- Stop opioid + stimulate patient + if pause or apnoea: mask ventilation with O2

- IV naloxone titration until FR >10, then naloxone infusion of the titrated dose until elimination of the opioid (usually 4 hours). Caution: duration of naloxone action = 30 min.

- Monitoring sedation and breathing

'''<u>Knowing how to do a strong opioid titration</u>''''

- Pure agonists are narrow-margin drugs (efficacy/overdose) for which treatment must be individualised.

- The process of finding a dosage that relieves pain is called titration, and the methods used vary according to the situation.

- Acute titration (Table 6) may be by injection (emergency department, immediate post-operative care) or orally (other acute pain).

- As the intensity of pain may fluctuate or the duration of intense pain is unknown, LP forms or continuous administration should be avoided from the outset.

.      In elderly patients or those with renal or respiratory insufficiency: doses halved (iv and oral), or spaced > 4 hours apart (oral titration).

'''Titration in cases of pain related to cancer or its metastases or chronic non-cancer pain (Table 7)'''

- These are situations where the duration of treatment may be >3 months, with a background treatment.

- For pain in the "r" position, treatment should be reassessed at each consultation. For extreme pain: possible IV treatment with PCA.

- For chronic non-cancer pain: treatment discontinuation to be considered if no benefit for dose ≥ 150 mg/d morphine equivalent or beyond 3 months, misuse, or unfavourable benefit/risk balance.

- In all cases: reduce doses by at least 50% for frail patients (elderly, with renal, hepatic or respiratory insufficiency, etc.) and give preference to LI forms for at least the first 72 hours.

'''A<u> multimodal analgesia (see heading)</u>''''

- Principle: ''combine analgesic molecules and techniques with different and complementary sites of action and different tolerance profiles''; allows a reduction in the dose of each product.  

'''<u>Writing a prescription for strong opioids</u>''''


- Drug regulation: ''secure prescriptions'' (include prescriber identification, prescription batch identification number, watermark, square where the prescriber must indicate the number of lines of medication prescribed).

- Details :

- the patient's identity (surname, first name, age and sex, if necessary height and weight);

- '''the date'''

- '''the route of administration'''

- '''the number of lines of treatment''' (box at the bottom of the prescription) ;

- '''the duration of treatment and the number of packaging units in words'''.

- ''his signature affixed immediately below the last line'', the remaining space being rendered unusable.

- Maximum prescription period :

- '''28 days for morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, methadone and buprenorphine'''

- '''28 d but split delivery of 14 d for transdermal fentanyl'''

- '''7 days for transmucosal fentanyl (unless the prescriber specifically states "one-off delivery")'''

- '''7 days for IV forms, except portable pump (28 days)'''

'''<u>Therapeutic education</u>''''

- Mechanisms of action, duration of action, differentiation between background treatment and attacks

- Undesirable effects of strong opioids and prevention, in particular informing of the risk of dependence and overdose

- Setting treatment objectives and criteria for discontinuing treatment in chronic non-cancer pain

- The place of strong opioids in the therapeutic strategy

- Discussing fears and perceptions of these treatments

- The importance of compliance (the main cause of failure) and to advise against family self-medication.
