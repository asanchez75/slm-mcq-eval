==Objectives:==
In localised stages, treatment is curative and always includes breast surgery and surgery of the homolateral axillary lymph nodes. Depending on the various prognostic/predictive factors and the type of surgery, chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy and/or treatment with trastuzumab (anti-HER2 antibody) and/or radiotherapy may be carried out in the (neo)adjuvant setting.

In the metastatic stages, treatment cannot be curative and is essentially based on systemic treatments (chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapies). The aim of these treatments is to increase patients' survival and improve their quality of life.

==Treatment principles:==
{| class="wikitable"
|'''Don't forget the associated measures:'''

- Discussion of the therapeutic strategy at a multidisciplinary consultation meeting (RCP) to define the optimal treatment for the patient.

- Announcement consultation, explanation of the personalised care plan (PPS).

- Application for exemption from co-payment (ALD 30).

- Comprehensive care, including psychological, social and dietary support.

- Supportive care deals with the consequences of the disease and its treatment, and can include pain management, nutrition, fatigue, fertility/sexuality, adapted physical activity sessions, art therapy, socio-aesthetic advice, etc.

===1/ Surgery===
Breast treatment may be conservative or radical, depending on the size of the tumour, the number of sites, the volume of the breast and any associated lesions (carcinoma in situ +++).

Surgery of the armpit is always associated with invasive carcinoma. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to drain the mammary gland: its anatomopathological analysis, when negative, makes it possible to dispense with the more morbid lymph node dissection; it involves double identification by injection of technetium and patent blue or by fluorescence using indocyanine green. If the lymph node is invaded preoperatively (positive puncture under ultrasound), axillary lymph node dissection is carried out immediately.

===2/ Radiotherapy===
Breast radiotherapy combines external radiotherapy of the whole breast and additional radiation in the operating bed ("boost"). It is used systematically after conservative surgery.

Parietal radiotherapy (after mastectomy) combined with additional dose in the operating bed is indicated in the presence of several poor prognostic factors.

Radiotherapy of the lymph nodes is justified in the case of axillary lymph node involvement (supra-clavicular fossa +/- internal mammary chain).

===3/ Systemic treatments===
In the localised stages of the disease, systemic treatments are either "adjuvant" (after surgery) or "neoadjuvant" (before surgery). The aim of (neo)adjuvant treatment is to destroy distant micro-metastases that are not detected by the extension work-up, thereby reducing the risk of relapse, particularly in the form of metastases.

In the metastatic stage, treatments are given throughout the course of the disease (except in the final palliative phase) and are adapted to the course of the disease and the patient's tolerance.

*Chemotherapy: the 2 main families used are anthracyclines and taxanes. Adverse reactions are detailed in item 294.

*Hormone therapy: either anti-oestrogen (tamoxifen) or anti-aromatase (letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane). The main hormonal effects are hot flushes, weight gain, arthralgia, thrombosis and increased risk of endometrial cancer (tamoxifen) and osteoporosis (anti-aromatase).

*Targeted therapies: a large number of targeted therapies are used in oncology. The main class that has made it possible to change the natural history of breast cancer by increasing the cure rate of certain cancers is the anti-HER2 class. The leader is trastuzumab.

===4/ Monitoring===
It includes :

*Joint management by: surgeon, medical oncologist, radiotherapist, general practitioner, gynaecologist, etc.

*a clinical breast examination at least twice a year for the first 5 years, then annually.

*A mammogram and ultrasound are carried out every year for life.

*Other examinations are carried out on request.

===5/ Support care===
This is systematic and helps to maintain quality of life. In the case of bone metastases, it is essential to prescribe a bisphosphonate or denosumab to limit bone complications. Deconditioning during exercise is often identified and may be the subject of a medical prescription for adapted physical activity.
