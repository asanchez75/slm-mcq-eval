The natural history of AD comprises three evolutionary phases:

- the pre-dementia or prodromal phase:

o onset of the symptomatic phase of the disease, most often revealed by memory complaints (forgetfulness as you go along)

o autonomy: ''minor neurocognitive disorder'' (cf. item 132 Definition Neurocognitive disorder): autonomy is preserved for most of the so-called instrumental activities of daily living (ability to use the telephone, to use means of transport, to manage taking medication, to handle money) ''([[Progressive loss of autonomy SDD-031|progressive loss of autonomy]])''''

o cognition: the neurocognitive disorder most often affects episodic memory; neuropsychological assessment shows a consolidation disorder in episodic memory (see next item) '''([[Memory disorders/cognitive decline SD-131|memory disorders/cognitive decline]])''''

- '''the state or dementia phase (mild to moderate)''' :

o autonomy: ''major neurocognitive disorder'' (cf. item 132 Definition Neurocognitive disorder): autonomy is significantly impaired for instrumental activities of daily living '''([[Progressive loss of autonomy SDD-031|progressive loss of autonomy]])''''

o cognition: the neurocognitive disorder is no longer centred on memory and now affects other cognitive functions: a syndrome known as "aphaso-apraxo-agnosic" and impairment of executive functions '''([[Memory disorders/cognitive decline SD-131|troubles de mémoire/déclin cognitif]])'''''

- the severe dementia phase:

o on average 7 to 8 years after the first symptoms of the disease are detected, preceding the end of life and often justifying institutionalisation

o autonomy: '''major neurocognitive disorder'' (cf. item 132 Definition Neurocognitive disorder) with a loss of autonomy not only for instrumental activities but also for basic activities of daily living (toileting, dressing, locomotion, eating) '''([[Progressive loss of autonomy SDD-031|progressive loss of autonomy]],''' ''[[Urinary incontinence SD-103|urinary incontinence]])'''''

o cognition: even more pronounced neurocognitive problems, which can go as far as not being recognised by close relatives

o psychological and behavioural symptoms of dementia (cf. Item 132 Positive diagnosis Psychological and behavioural symptoms of dementia): possibly present to varying degrees at all stages of AD, they are very frequent at this stage: agitation or apathy '''([[Agitation SDD-114|agitation]], [[Apathy SDD-117|apathy]])''', hallucinations '''([[Hallucinations SDD-122|hallucinations]])''', delusional disorders '''([[Delusional ideas SDD-124|delusional ideas]])''', wandering, sleep disorders '''([[Sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia SDD-135|sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia]])'''' and appetite disorders

o neurological and somatic disorders : walking and posture disorders with falls '''([[Appearance of difficulty in walking SD-066|appearance of difficulty in walking]], [[Fall in the elderly SDD-027|fall in the elderly]], [[Balance disorders SD-130|balance disorders]])''', epilepsy (corresponding items), myoclonus '''([[Abnormal movements SDD-126|abnormal movements]])''', sphincter control disorders '''([[Urinary incontinence SD-103|urinary incontinence]]),''' and undernutrition '''([[Undernutrition/malnutrition SDD-030|undernutrition/malnutrition]])'''''

o death from a general complication due to the bedridden state (bronchial superinfection, following a fall with prolonged bed rest...) or by sudden death '''([[Swallowing disorders or miscarriage SDD-062|swallowing disorders or miscarriage]], [[Fall in the elderly SDD-027|fall in the elderly]], [[Weight loss SD-017|weight loss]], [[Asthenia SD-021|asthenia]])''''

Follow-up consists of detecting, preventing or compensating through supportive care for the clinical manifestations of AD at all stages and their associated complications '''([[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SD-298|consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]])'''
