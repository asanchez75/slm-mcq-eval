In order to encourage the development of the child's skills and those of his or her family, and to enable the child to participate as much as possible (family life, the society in which he or she lives, etc.) ([[Situation of disability SD-345|Situation of disability]]), multidisciplinary care is proposed.


A care plan that includes the family and focuses on the objectives of the child and his/her family is defined by the team. It specifies the objectives, the actions to achieve them and the evaluations.


Care should begin as early as possible, as soon as a deficit appears or a gap is noted, even in the absence of a formal diagnosis, so as not to delay ([[Psychomotor development abnormality SD-115|Psychomotor development abnormality]]<nowiki/>r). Most often, families spot these disorders.  The medical consultation should enable the child to be positioned in relation to typical development and if necessary explore the disorders. [[Paediatric follow-up consultation SD-296|(Paediatric follow-up consultation)]], [[Announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family)]]


The health record is a good tool for screening and sharing.


It comprises 3 areas of care: medical, re-educational and, if necessary, psychological.

The medical aspect aims to diagnose the aetiology of the disability, to prevent potential complications linked to deficiencies and activity limitations, and to propose strategies to enable the child to achieve maximum competence and independence. The doctor intervenes by prescribing medication, rehabilitation, technical aids, etc. ([[Prescribe appropriate rehabilitation]]) Different doctors may be involved: the PRM, the paediatrician, the general practitioner, the surgeon.

In the area of rehabilitation, different professionals are likely to be involved, depending on the deficit assessed: physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, psychomotor therapists, orthoptists, orthoprosthetists, chiropodists, etc.


In addition to measures to deal with impairments and disabilities, measures to deal with disabilities can also be put in place. In the school, a personalised schooling project (PPS) or an individualised reception project can be proposed, and an AESH can help a child with a disability. The MDPH can set up a personalised education plan and provide financial assistance.

A social worker can be called in to help the family with the formalities ([[Comprehensive support for a carer SD-330|comprehensive support for a carer]]).
